# VAULT InvenioRDM

CCA InvenioRDM instance. This is mostly a cookiecutter Invenio project with additional documentation for us.

## Setup

Requires Docker, python 3.9, pipenv, node, and npm 7. `invenio-cli check-requirements --development` will check if you have all these. To install on an M2 Mac, it seems that additional packages are needed: `brew install cairo libffi pkg-config`.

Finally, the invenio-saml module requires an outdated version of `xmlsec1` which you can't get from homebrew. Eric made a local tap with the requisite version. First, download install Xcode and open it to accept the license agreement. Then `brew tap phette23/local` and `brew install xmlsec1@1.2.37`.

```sh
git clone https://gitlab.com/california-college-of-the-arts/invenio && cd invenio
pip install invenio-cli # install invenio-cli globally
invenio-cli install --dev # creates the virtualenv, install dependencies, & some other setup
invenio-cli services setup --no-demo-data # sets up db, cache, search, task queue
invenio-cli run # runs the application
```

See our "notes" folder for further documentation.
